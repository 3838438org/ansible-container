Reference Guide
===============

Yes, we need a reference guide for ``container.yml``. One is in progress and will eventually live here. For now, the
best reference is found in the example project. Take a look at `example/ansible/container.yml <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/blob/develop/example/ansible/container.yml>`_.
